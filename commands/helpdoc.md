!adapt-methods
<https://polyphasic.net/polyphasic-sleep/adaptation/adaptation-methods/>

Adaptation methods include exaptation, gradual adaptation and the cold turkey.
Please note that none of the alternative methods would shorten adaptation time, and can worsen symptoms during adaptation if extra sleep deprivation is incurred.

Cold turkey: Jump straight into your desired schedule.

Exaptation methods: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtORS3GIqVQ>
Recovery: See `!recovery`.
Staying awake before starting: Stay awake for around 36h, then jump into the desired schedule.
Naptation: Stay awake for up to 36h, then start napping for 20m every 2 or 3 hours with the intention of practicing your napping skills, then jump into the desired schedule.

Gradual adaptation methods: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMjR9t0WBzk>
Gradual adaptation: First adapt to a high total sleep schedule, then start another adaptation by following the schedule line to adapt to another schedule with a lower total sleep time.
Reverse gradual adaptation: Adapt to a schedule with a higher total sleep time from an already adapted schedule.
Fast gradual adaptation: Reduce the time spent adapting by switching to a lower total sleep time schedule before the previous adaptation is complete.
Rhythmic preservation: Reduce your total sleep time by switching to a schedule with a lower total sleep time, while not changing the number of sleep blocks.
Uberman as a precursor to E3: Start an Uberman adaptation and switch to E3 after enough SWS pressure has accumulated.

!adapt-success
<https://polyphasic.net/adaptation/#adaptation-success>

Signs to recognize when you have adapted to a schedule, in order of importance:
1. Feel energized and productive when awake, no memory loss, elevation in mood and good appetite.
2. Wake up feeling refreshed whether the nap or the core. No sleep inertia.
3. Fall asleep fast in all sleeps, even without much preparation beforehand.

Possible bonus signs:
4. Wake naturally without alarms. This requires long entrainment with a sleep cycle, often months for it to be consistent.
5. You might remember more dreams from your sleep, and more vivid dreams (the dreams can come from the end of your core sleep, or you can even dream right when you fall asleep shortly). Some people remember fewer dreams, due to consistently waking from light sleep as an adaptation to rigid sleep times.

!adaptation
<https://polyphasic.net/polyphasic-sleep/adaptation/>
<https://youtu.be/Jh7Tqj88KBI>
**Stage 1:**
Since sleep deprivation levels are low, waking up is easy for most sleep blocks. The sleep quality is the same as before. The sleep cycle length is unaltered (~90m, presumably). This stage usually lasts about a week, but can shorten on extreme schedules or if starting with significant sleep deprivation.
**Stage 2:**
Tiredness starts building up; waking up and staying awake becomes harder. Falling asleep for the new sleep times starts to become easier. This stage can last up to a week or so, depending on the initial amounts of sleep deprivation.
**Stage 3:**
By this point, sleep debt has accumulated enough to cause oversleeps (especially so with extreme schedules). It is important to have a good alarm setup by this point. Dreams may appear more often. Falling asleep and waking up may become very hard for some or all sleeps. Repartitioning has begun. Your sleep cycles can be shortened. This stage takes at least about 3 weeks - (stage 1 + stage 2) .
**Stage 4:**
If you make it through stage 3 without significant oversleeps you enter stage 4. During this stage the symptoms get progressively better. Natural wakes become more frequent, dreams are more vivid. Both falling asleep and waking up become very easy, and you start to feel more alert during the day. When you meet all `!adapt-success` signs you've adapted!

!alarms
Have multiple devices with multiple alarms go off at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes after scheduled wake time. Have the first alarm be some upbeat music that makes sure you wake up with the feeling of being able to do anything!

Make smart use of barcode alarms to force yourself to leave bed; for example you could place a code in the fridge (pushing you to drink a glass of cold water), or in the shower. Turn off the alarms after they each go off, don't turn them off all at once.

It's imperative to use more than one device, since if that device fails you likely won't get up.

Popular options for alarm apps are "Alarmy", and "I Can't Wake Up". You can ask about what different people use in <#332217877614690304>, if you want something special. If you have a person that could wake you, make a backup alarm that's loud enough for them to hear, and make sure they know to wake you no matter what.

Dedicated alarm devices can be found by typing `!products`, or at <https://polyphasic.net/adaptation/products/>

!alcohol
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/substances/#alcohol>

Alcohol affects sleep in many different ways. It can reduce REM & SWS and can cause intermittent wakes during sleep leaving you feeling groggy and unrested on wake. This completely destroys your quality of sleep and can be detrimental to adaptation. It is best to avoid alcohol completely during adaptation. If you wish to indulge post adaptation, moderate consumption with some time before sleep should be tolerable.

!caffeine
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/substances/#caffeine>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6hvpWGw4g>
Caffeine calculator: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dH_AsN1TuqWjKhJlKv9o_C-tGx5LaUywJa8IyL0hIhY/edit#gid=0>

Significant amounts of caffeine shouldn't be consumed at all during adaptation. It can help you, but you'll feel worse after the effects of the caffeine fade out. Caffeine's half-life is on average 6.5h (the time it takes for the caffeine amount in your body to be halved; it takes about 12-18h to be mostly removed). Therefore, it's better to consume decaffeinated drinks.

Caffeine replaces valuable REM and SWS with light sleep, meaning that even if you could fall asleep, its quality suffers a lot.

The one exception is Segmented; here it's okay to consume a moderate amount in the morning. Note that use past noon should still be avoided. The other one is Biphasic-X (check `!non-reducing` for more info), where the nap in most cases contains only light sleep and therefore won’t be affected by caffeine(if you can still fall asleep).

!cannabis
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/substances/#cannabis>

A very limited amount of research has been done with regards to cannabis affecting sleep. Research and anecdotal evidence points to cannabis reducing the amount of REM sleep and increasing SWS, possibly also increasing it's daily need. Because of this it should be completely avoided during adaptation, and consumption should at least be kept at a moderate amount after adaptation. See `!drugs`.


!circadian
<https://polyphasic.net/sleep-mechanics/biological-rhythms/#circadian-rhythm>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ogvGuZicLY>
<https://polyphasic.net/courses/essential-health-considerations-on-polyphasic-schedules-the-ultimate-course-on-the-dark-period/>

Your circadian rhythm is set by blue/green light and food intake (also partly by temperature and physical activity); to keep it intact it's wise to keep a 6-12 (preferably 8-10) hour dark period (with only red light allowed, see `!darkperiod`) coinciding with an 8-12 hour fasting period. Both the dark period and the fasting should start 2h prior to the core. Not doing so compromises the quality of your core sleep, and leads to elevated risks of getting diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

The length of the dark period can directly affect the amount of SWS in the core, which means minor tweaking of the length of the dark period can be beneficial in order to get high amounts of quality sleep. The effects can be seen with a sleep tracker, see `!sleeptracker`.

You should also make sure that you get plenty of light until about 1h before darkperiod. If it is dark outside long before you start your darkperiod, you should consider using daylight lamps. (check `!products` for more info)


!cyclelength
<https://polyphasic.net/sleep-mechanics/#sleep-cycles>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNRERB0PNRw>

Sleep cycle is defined as the time interval between two REM episodes. It’s natural length in humans usually varies between 80-120m, with the average of 90 min. Due to influences of the circadian rhythm, SWS is often most prevalent in the evening sleep cycles, while REM is more prevalent in the morning.
Sleep cycle length may be compressed or decompressed to some extent. This depends on the length of a core. For example, a core of 2.5h will most likely have two shorter cycles, while 3.5h can have a bit longer ones (though exceptions are possible).

Sleep cycle length change is mostly observed in the dual core line because of the non-standard length of cores. Usually compression is also possible for standard 90m cycle cores, since some light sleep might be inserted at the end of sleep blocks after adaptation (see `!wake-time-programming`). If you start regularly waking up before the alarm, you can assume the cycles have compressed more. In that case the alarms can be altered to accommodate this.


!darkperiod
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/#dark-period>
<https://polyphasic.net/courses/essential-health-considerations-on-polyphasic-schedules-the-ultimate-course-on-the-dark-period/>
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUAAjfe7mcrUv214LqqeBhsivjnxUtA_I>

Melatonin is essential for entering SWS, however it's production is delayed by blue, green, and to a lesser extent yellow light. Because of this, you should maintain a dark period, in which only red light is allowed.
Dark period should start 2h prior to the core (first core on DC schedules, night core on Triphasic) and continue for 6-12h (preferably 8-10h) after that (time spent sleeping counts as inside the dark period). The reason it should continue even after your wake time (if you have a short core) is to ensure the stability of the circadian rhythm.
Darkness is still preferred over red light, so using dark themes is preferable. The light blocking can be done by either wearing blue-green light blocking glasses (red laser goggles) or by using programs such as F.lux, sunsetscreen etc on a low kelvin setting (around 1000K). Having red light bulbs is also an option. Please note that LCD screens will inevitably leak backlight, which is white, so it is still better to use goggles. Check `!products` for some of the things mentioned here.

Also try to avoid intense physical activities during the dark period.

Schedule line specifics
DC: if your cores are within 5h from each other the dark period should cover the whole core gap.
E: the dark period should be extended until the end of the first nap as long as the total duration of the dark period does not exceed 12h.
Triphasic: the gap between the night and dawn cores should be covered in the dark period

For why this is important, see `!circadian`


!dayblock
If you can't nap at all during the work day (> 7-8h), your options will be limited, because most schedules with more than two sleeps cannot accommodate such a large gap between sleeps. You might be able choose:
Segmented, which allows a full day without any nap
E1 or siesta with a nap/core after work, plus a relatively late core
Just being able to take one consistent 20m nap before lunch or instead of your lunch would greatly expand your options.
!diet
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/dietary-considerations/>
Intermittent fasting is fine for polyphasic sleep, and a ketogenic (low-carb) diet should pose no problems. Make sure to keep at least an 8-hour fasting period (no food) that coincides with the dark period.
On E2 and E3, do not eat until after the first nap.
On Segmented and DC schedules, do not eat between the cores.
For more advice, ask in <#346655487326027787>
!discipline
<https://polyphasic.net/adaptation/strictness-of-sleep-times/>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIIyPpgCdd4>
When adapting to a schedule, stick to ALL sleep times in your schedule tightly. Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday as scheduled. Even if you don't fall asleep fast at first, keep sticking with your schedule, and eventually you will be fast asleep when sleep times come. Try not to oversleep during adaptation. Depending on your schedule, small mess-ups should still be tolerable and you can still adapt after around one month or so.  
!drugs
Avoid all drugs that alter your sleep either directly (messes with sleep stages/cycle lengths, makes you sleepy/more alert etc) or indirectly (makes you lose control in some way). This includes almost all psychoactive drugs and some others too. This is especially important during adaptation, check in <#346655487326027787> or read some studies if you're unsure about a certain drug.
See also: `!alcohol` `!nicotine` `!cannabis` `!caffeine`
!dst
DST or daylight saving time, is when clocks are seasonally adjusted to lengthen the perceived daytime by forcing people to wake up earlier.

DST can be hard on your schedule, since rotating it during adaptation will confuse your body as to when it's supposed to sleep. Tiredness/grogginess during the wrong times is not uncommon. You have two main options:

1. Rotate the schedule 1h/the required amount in a single day.
2. Stick to the old schedule (preferred if you can)

You might think it would be better to rotate the schedule gradually (5-10min/day) as it would be less noticeable to the body. However, through experiments we have found that people generally feel worse for longer. Therefore, gradual change is not recommended.

If you're planning to start a polyphasic sleep schedule but have DST coming up soon it's wise to either go with the schedule you'll end up with in the end or wait until DST change occurs before switching schedules.

!dualcore
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/dual-core/>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIMQgcn_RCU>
Dual Core (DC) schedules split the night sleep into 2 cores in order to hit both the sws (21-24) and rem (06-09) peaks to achieve the optimal quality sleep. Due to the placement of the cores, the first core will contain mostly SWS, while the other one will contain mostly REM.
People who often wake up during the night without being able to fall back asleep easily might have a natural tendency toward segmented, and DC schedules are thus recommended for them.
Cycle compression is present in the DC-line (see `!cyclelength`).

!everyman
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfS5GSd2mtY>
The Everyman (E) line has one single core and a number of naps during the day. The idea behind this line is that since later cycles mostly contain REM, each one of them can be traded for a nap in the day which contains a similar amount of REM.

The core of the E schedules can be scheduled slightly later than the DC ones, since the core should contain both SWS and REM. However, it should still not be too late, as the core might not provide all the needed SWS. See `!latecore` for more info.

After adaptation the naps of E1 and E2 can be quite flexible; in order to gain some flexibility with E3 the core might have to be extended to 3.5h. DO NOT flex at all during adaptation. Check `!flexing` for more info.
E4 is below the minimum sleep threshold, and should generally be avoided.

!exercise
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/#exercise>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ2e5eRYoxg>
People who do a lot of intense muscle building (HIIT, lifting, etc) should have at least 3 cycles in their core (first core for DC) to handle the increased SWS need. Cardio does not significantly affect SWS needs.

Most people should leave a 2h gap between exercising and sleeping in order to avoid having the exercise interfere with the sleep.
It is advised to do cardio in the morning and lifting in the evening post-adaptation.

During adaptation it's best to avoid doing too much lifting and increasing the SWS need, since it can cause an oversleep. Because sleep deprivation hinders muscle gain, you also won't get the desired results.

Exercising can be beneficial to you during adaptation, since it can help you wake up and stay awake during difficult times.


!experiments
The Experiments group aims to study how different substances and activities (like caffeine, meditation, and sugar) affect sleep with the aid of EEG sleep trackers. This improves the legitimacy of the community and helps exchange speculative claims into scientific ones. After enough data is gathered the results will be posted on the polyphasic website. The Experiments group is looking for adapted polyphasic or monophasic sleepers with sleep trackers, people who plan on getting sleep trackers or people who are willing to help contribute to the community by analyzing data, programming or are otherwise just curious for what happens in the R&D side of the server. If any of these criteria fit you please tag a moderator and ask them to give you the ‘Experimenter’ role!
!eyestrain
If you have problems with eye strain during screen use, it is suggested that you take regular breaks and switch to paper media for reading. Also, from around 2h before core and until about 6-10 hours afterwards you should only allow red light to hit your eyes. Check `!darkperiod` for more info
!fallasleep
When starting adaptation you may find it difficult to fall asleep for your scheduled core or naps. Don’t worry, this is totally normal and will fix itself over time - the important thing is that you remain consistent with the time that you go into bed and leave bed. Eventually your brain will pick up on the times it can fall asleep and will have enough sleep pressure to fall asleep at the scheduled times.

Try to lower your body temperature to fall asleep more easily. Create a sleep-inducing environment like a dark, cool and quiet room. Try focusing on your breath, inhale and exhale at regular intervals.
Keep away from thoughts; perhaps try reading something entertaining before bed. Have a hot shower around 1h before sleep time. listen to lulling music, brown/white noise or ASMR. Stay away from electronics (esp. screens) at least 15m before bedtime.

If you fail to fall asleep even after a long time on the schedule doing a harder one, like Naptation, E3 etc, until you fall asleep reliably is an option. The ability to nap is a skill that's been anecdotally proven to stick even after going back to mono for a long time, so recovering after learning to fall asleep is recommended. See `!recovery`.

Should you not be able to sleep for longer than 30 minutes try getting out of bed and doing something lightly distracting for a few minutes and retrying. If this continues and you’re not doing a dark period, consider doing so.

!flexing
<https://polyphasic.net/flexible-sleep-timing/>
Flexing means to start one or more scheduled sleeps at different times on different days, keeping the sleep length the same. It's strongly discouraged for beginner polysleepers, and has the best chance of success after being adapted for a month or two to a strict schedule. Learning to flex successfully requires an adaptation as well.

Nap can be flexed as little as 15 minutes in either direction, or as much as 2-3hours either direction, which takes longer to adapt to. Always keep at least 2-3hrs gap between sleeps even if flexing. Napping in peak SWS pressure of circadian rhythm (broadly 20:00 through 02:00) is still strongly discouraged. For E2/E3, flexing the first nap is much more difficult than the other ones and should be avoided.

Gradually increasing flex range is recommended, and you can start with flexing just one nap to be safe. Flexing the core is harder and not recommended, but possible to a small degree for experienced polysleepers. Length of adaptation increases with difficulty of base schedule, number of sleeps flexed, range of flexing, and how much (if at all) you are flexing a core.

Flexing is much more difficult on schedules with low sleep totals. Some people have found success in flexing by adding 30m or 90m to core. Choose a schedule with at least 5.5hrs total sleep per day.  (As far as only 4.5h daily,  several people have adapted to flexing naps in E3 with a 3.5h core and a stable first nap.)

!genetics
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H13f4CGC0yQ>

People with specific genetic mutations can function optimally on much less sleep than a normal human being. Most people need 7-8h of sleep per day (monophasic sleep) to be fully functional, however some people need less than 6h of total sleep each day. Shorter mono baseline often makes shortened schedules doable.

As we know from the collected EEG data by some community members, vital sleep stages requirements (SWS and REM) also vary widely in different individuals, for example one may need/get only 50m of SWS consistently on mono of a normal length. Those with the lower vital stages baseline can take on schedules like Uberman, Dymaxion, SPAMAYL, etc with the possibility to succeed long term.

Note: It’s often stated that lower mono baseline correlates with lower vitals need. However, recent community EEG data has shown that some healthy short sleepers have normal SWS requirements, about 90 minutes. As such, nap-only schedules might still not be possible.
!latecore
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwxVWyH4Uo>
Having a late core requires extra effort with managing your circadian rhythm. If the core doesn't start between 20 and 24 solar time (21-23 for DC schedules) circadian management is going to be required (see `!circadian`), in which you try to make the brain think you are living in a different timezone than where you actually are. The less sleeping time the core has, the harder having a late core will be.

It's easier to pull off a late core if the bedtime doesn't change after starting adaptation. If there's a big switch in the time when the core starts the risk of getting an SWS rebound increases a lot, even for schedules with over 2 cycles in the core.


!memory
During adaptation your memory might be impaired due to lowered amounts of REM and SWS, but after adaptation it will be restored to that of a natural wake mono or possibly better due to the frequent naps.

SWS is responsible for storage of declarative/explicit memory, such as “X happened on date Y” or  “A in the body does thing B”

REM is responsible for storage of procedural memory, i.e. remembering how to do certain things by following a procedure, such as riding a bike or playing piano. REM is also responsible for emotionally and spatial memory consolidation (together with light sleep).

If you're trying to learn procedures by repetition, napping can boost that. If you're trying to remember factual information, naps generally would not help and hence it's best to study before the core.

Many things require a bit of both SWS and REM. When you are learning something you probably have some sort of impact on most of the memory types, so getting good quality sleep is going to help you regardless, it's better to study, sleep, then take the test, than it is to pull an all nighter, as you're much more likely to have a good recall after sleeping.

!melatonin
Melatonin supplement is useful for setting core bedtime earlier or later than it has been, just like its common use for jet lag. This is especially useful for setting your circadian rhythm on the first 1-4 days of your new schedule.
For polyphasic, it's recommended NOT to use extended time-release melatonin, as those are designed for mono-length sleeps. Typically only take for a few nights at a time. Amount of melatonin effective will vary per person. Toxicity of melatonin is known to be extremely low, but common doses range from 1-5mg, or 10mg in rare cases.

!nap-eat
Eat a regular meal around 2-3h before a nap (digestion before sleep), or after a nap. Some light snacks are ok within 1-2h before nap.
!naplength
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/scheduling/#naps>
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/advanced-scheduling-options/#protracted-naps>
Generally, 20m naps are preferred since they are easy to schedule and reduce the chance for SWS wakes, while still giving enough time to gain REM. Do not allow yourself more than 2m to fall asleep (stick with 20m preferably). Once sleep deprivation starts to kick in you will fall asleep within minutes, and if your naps are any longer you risk entering SWS; which is unpleasant to wake from. If you want to sleep longer, try aiming for a full cycle of 90m, which allows gaining both REM and SWS, and avoids SWS wakes.

If you don't have the ability to take 20m naps, you can replace one 20m nap with two 15m naps.

A longer nap (up to ~45min) around circadian dawn (first nap for e2 and e3), known as a pronap, is possible and can help with gaining extra REM, potentially making a schedule easier.

!napspot
Try to avoid sleeping in bed since it increases the risk of oversleeping. Sleeping on a flat surface (with carpet) is recommended for spine assistance, waking on time, and other health benefits. It's possible to train yourself to sleep while sitting, being in a car or laying on an uncomfortable surface. Stick to it and you'll fall asleep eventually!
!nicotine
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/substances/#smoking-nicotine>
Nicotine should be completely avoided while doing a Polyphasic Sleeping schedule. Nicotine has a half life of about 2 hours after which it gets turned into cotinine which has a half-life of about 19 hours. Both of these are stimulants, which means they will make it harder to fall asleep and reduce the quality of the sleep you do get (replacing SWS and REM with light sleep), making polyphasic sleep difficult. Nicotine can also alter the circadian rhythm.
!nightshift
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/working-life-considerations/#third-shift>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhXNzE-JuZw>
For those who work night shifts, polyphasic sleep can be possible, if:
1. You can have a short nap at work.
2. Your night shift schedule is stable everyday, for a long time to come.
3. You don't have any health problems (night shift workers tend to have higher blood pressure, heart rate, even some sleep disorders, due to messed-up biological clock).
For health benefits, any form of biphasic sleep is a good choice. One core sleep after work, when you go home, and a small nap before you go to work is a good approach to take on. Other sleep schedules can be chosen, but beware of a tougher adaptation process.


!ns
NS stands for Newcomer Syndrome, which often happens to new polyphasic sleepers, who aim for the hardest sleep schedules like Uberman, Tesla, and Dymaxion without knowing their basic vital sleep stages needs from EEG readings. This syndrome is dangerous because it cultivates the misconception that everyone can sleep as little as 2 hours per day while gaining superhuman productivity. (You most likely cannot.)

The adaptation to these hostile schedules is extremely severe, let alone sticking with them long term (can still cause physical/mental exhaustion long-term, due to the great lack of deep sleep stages to provide sufficient recovery for daily sleep needs).

If you're a newcomer, please be realistic in choosing a suitable sleep schedule for yourself, and take your time to consider what's best for your own well-being.
Try to stay above 4h of sleep if you're over 21. If you're between 18 and 21 you should get at least 5 hours of sleep, and if you're underage, see `!underage`.


!oss
OSS stands for "oversleeping syndrome." This applies to those who keep oversleeping when adapting to a sleep schedule, but still keep moving on and claiming they will adapt eventually. The syndrome is also fatal for adaptation, because:

1. Oversleeps mess up one's circadian rhythm and sleep compression entirely. The body is trying to adjust to a certain sleep schedule, but this can only happen with NO oversleeping.
2. As sleep is not stabilized (oversleeping when supposed to be awake), the person will fail to adapt to a schedule and thus will constantly be sleep deprived, which can have long term health consequences.

The solution to this syndrome is generally to go back to monophasic sleep for at least 1-2 weeks to recover from sleep deprivation, then attempt to adapt to a polyphasic schedule again. This is called "recovery" (see `!recovery`).

Often, this syndrome can involve habitually turning off alarms and going back to sleep. In this case, you would want to avoid using alarms for a while and then start again, committing yourself to waking up immediately after the alarm to recondition your brain.

!polyprep
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b--yFIJRUZ0>
- Take some time to prepare for your schedule if possible. Quit caffeine, nicotine, drugs and extra sugar before starting. Start eating healthier and exercising. Recover from sleep debt (check `!recovery`)
- Begin teaching yourself to get up the moment you wake up. Start having both a night and morning routine. It is absolutely imperative to quit snoozing, or turning off alarms and going back to sleep.
- Inform people around you about what you will be doing and how this is going to be affecting both you and them.
- Start scouting out possible locations where you can nap.
- Read up to understand polyphasic adaptation and what to expect. That includes other help commands (use `!help` to see the list), <https://polyphasic.net/>, and asking any questions you have on Discord.
- Consider shifting your current core wake time or bedtime toward your new core's bedtime or wake time, if either is possible, to help condition the body for the new schedule.
--  Install and practice using all apps you may need, like alarm apps, F.lux/Twilight/Sunsetscreen, or productivity apps.
--  Ensure your health and safety if you have any stress-aggravated medical conditions, like cardiovascular problems or seizures or suicidal thoughts, as you will be going through weeks of mild to severe sleep deprivation. Severity depends on the person and the schedule.  See a doctor to determine if short-term sleep deprivation is an acceptable risk for you.
--  Create at least two long lists:
1. Tasks toward major, motivating goals that inspire your interest in more time or better sleep.
2. Easy, time-consuming tasks that you can make yourself do while tired and unmotivated, like cleaning or cooking.

!prematurewake
If you wake prematurely (<5m on a nap, <30m on a core), get out of bed. Don't try to cram in more sleep until the alarm rings. You might fall asleep and wake up in SWS, or sleep through your alarm. Falling back asleep could also be difficult and thus you'd spend time unnecessarily trying to do so.

!recovery
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxAO6u87lTU>

Recovery is sleeping with natural wakes to pay off sleep debt. This is usually done for 1-2 weeks, but it can take less time or more time depending on the amount of sleep deprivation accumulated. While doing recovery one should have a set time for the start of the sleep.

Recovery is usually done:
-before doing a polyphasic sleep schedule, if one is sleep deprived
-after falling into OSS
-after one oversleep so big you know you won't be able to continue due to the huge setback

Mono-recovery is the prefered recovering schedule (one core), but it's also possible to recover on biphasic schedules (will likely take longer due to the alleviated sleep deprivation during the day):
E1-recovery, one 20m nap during the day and a core in the night without an alarm
Siesta-recovery, one 90m core during the day and a core in the night without an alarm
Segmented-recovery, one 3,5h core, followed by a break and another core without an alarm.

Recovering from a polyphasic schedule often follows this pattern:
A few days with a short core (due to the body remembering to wake up early)
-> many days with a long core
-> 2-3 days of core times of the usual length
This is when one is done recovering, when the sleep has stabilized at a set length that's of similar length to before attempting polyphasic sleep, around 6-8h for most adults

If recovery with natural wakes is impossible due to scheduling limitations doing it with as much sleep as one can get is possible, but recovering will take a longer amount of time.


!repartition
During adaptation and after adaptation to a polyphasic schedule is successful, sleep stage repartition is complete. Repartition means the rearrangement of sleep stages into each sleep (core/nap) in your schedule. This results in a nap possibly full of SWS in the evening, another nap full of REM around dawn for example.
__Before repartitioning__: When one first begins polyphasic sleep, sleep stages have not been repartitioned. The process of falling asleep goes like this: Sleeper enters NREM1 (Non-REM), light sleep, with wakeful state for some time, then NREM2, starting to fall asleep and reality of surrounding fades and awareness gradually becomes null, NREM3 (or SWS, aka slow-wave sleep), a stage that they sleep the deepest, and there's usually no dreaming in this stage, and finally REM (rapid eye movement) where dreams occur. And this process applies to monophasic sleepers.
__After repartitioning__: Once adaptation is complete, your sleep schedule is stabilized in each sleep. It's common to expect a very dreamy nap around dawn in your location, suggesting that the nap is REM dominant. You will obviously go through NREM1 and NREM2 (takes some time to fall asleep), but you bypass NREM3 to enter REM. Since adaptation is successful, you wake up easily and after around 15m of REM (this number is just an example), you enter NREM1, then wake up comfortably. If you nap late in the day, close to evening, the results vary - you might enter REM very fast after lying down, or it could be an SWS dominant nap, in which you can't recall dreams, or sleep very deeply. Or you could get both SWS and REM in just a 20m nap, which is still possible. Conclusively, after repartitioning is complete, NREM1 and NREM2 are reduced in your sleeps, saving space for SWS and REM which are more important for physical and mental functions.

!sickness

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQB-Fcxly6M>

When you're sick with anything more than a mild flu (with symptoms above the neck), it's best to return to monosleep, to fully recover before continuing polyphasic sleep. If you are adapted to a schedule and get sick, you can still be polyphasic, but lengthen your core sleep(s) and nap(s) to extend recovery. During sleep deprivation of polyphasic sleep, it will be worse for your immune system to resist sickness.
Try boosting your immune system before trying to adapt again. Make sure you're eating healthy, exercising and so on!

Naps can be replaced by an extra full cycle; do not use a random length.

!skipnap
During adaptation (first month), it's best to follow your schedule strictly, and avoid oversleeping and skipping naps or changing your sleep schedule continuously.
If you're going to miss sleep it's best to skip rather than to move, since moving counts as an oversleep (any sleep outside of schedule), which sets you back.

Losing a nap means you'll increase the risk of an oversleep later, so be sure you're prepared for this. Set up extra alarms or ask someone to check on you to make sure you're awake.

Move your sleeps only if you know not doing so will result in an even bigger oversleep later. Make sure it's not too close to the next nap/core sleep (spare around 4h before the next core sleep, if your nap is 30m or below).

If you have to skip some parts of your core, do it in chunks of 90m (full cycles) to avoid waking up in the middle of them (increased SWS wake risk). If you have to skip your whole core try to at least get some naps in during that time.

!sleepdebt
Depending on how much sleep you sleep on monophasic schedule, sleep debt can hit you hard or not at all when you are adapting to a polyphasic pattern. Generally, expect sleep debts to build and hit you around week 2 or 3, if you don't oversleep.
Eventually the sleep debt will allow you to fall asleep instantly for your sleeps.
When enough sleep debt builds up you'll get a REM rebound, which inserts REM into the beginning of every sleep, and on schedules with a split SWS core/with low amounts of sleep you can also expect an SWS rebound to occur.
Repartition happens because of sleep debt and sticking to your schedule, see `!repartition`


!sleeptracker
<https://polyphasic.net/sleep-tracking/introduction/>
Most products claiming to track your sleep are inaccurate, since they are based only on body movement. This includes most fitness trackers and apps. Generally, anything that does not have electrodes on the head will not produce useful results.

Sleep trackers that the users here are experienced with are the Olimex openEEG (+-200$); and the Zeo.
The Olimex is a semi-DIY solution that produces great results; the Zeo is an out-of-the-box solution but only available secondhand, as the company behind it went under in 2013. Expect to pay 60-100$ for a Zeo. The Zeo is less accurate than the Olimex.
Other head-mounted solutions may or may not provide the right results; when in doubt, ask in <#346655487326027787> for more information!

!smartalarm
<https://polyphasic.net/sleep-tracking/introduction/>
App or smartband-based smartalarms will be very unreliable; since they rely on sub-par sleeptracking to work. (most are below 50% accurate.)
The Zeo Bedside's "gentle wake up" could be considered if on mono; Wake up lights can be considered for mono, E1, Siesta, and the second core of Segmented.

The different wake-up times of "smartalarms" will keep you from stabilizing to waking up the same time each day on your own. This means that in the long-term, you'd wake up feeling good on more days if you keep a regular alarm than if you'd use an unpredictable smart-alarm. Poly can't normally handle the random sleep reductions; cutting out 30m is a big deal.
!stayawake
<https://polyphasic.net/adaptation/managing-sleep-deprivation/>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QSoS6Jfx8>

If you're too sleepy, try increasing body temperature to stay awake. That includes eating protein, doing some exercise (jumping jacks, walking, a set of pushups, plank, etc), or focus on doing something you love. Keep your mind in an excited state.
!sugar
Consuming too much sugar should be avoided. After consumption of mainly sugar you get a boost in energy for up to 45 minutes, during which it's going to be very hard to fall asleep. Abundant sugar mixed with plenty of fiber, protein, and/or fat should reduce the intensity of the sugar high but increase its duration.  When this wears off, you'll reach an energy low for as long as a couple hours where you risk oversleeping.

The quality of your sleep will also suffer. SWS will be replaced by light sleep and you'll be more prone to waking up in the middle of your sleep (which will also result in a lower quality sleep).

!tankphasic
Here's the battery-charge principle that shows the relationship of how our body gets REM, SWS and our performance on polyphasic sleep:

We have *two different batteries*
 (REM battery and SWS battery) and they usually refill when we're asleep. These two batteries have different capacities and they recharge at different speeds. The charging circuit has to switch between them to make sure they're both decently filled because it can only charge one at a time.
Now if one of the batteries is completely empty (REM runs out faster), you don't have enough power left to wake up, sorry, or you just shut off without warning...and when its very low, some stuff shuts off completely to save power (zombie mode, in which you oversleep and later wake and don't remember anything) or it intermittently shuts off for small periods of time to try and slow down the battery drain (microsleep, in which you doze off for a few seconds and up to some minutes).

 When the battery is just low, but not very low, you feel sleep deprived (like when you get the red power indicator light, or that annoying  "your battery is running low" popup warning). When the battery is medium or higher you feel okay (green light, no warnings). Like a normal battery it takes way way more time to get from empty to full than it takes to get from empty to medium. The SWS battery doesn't usually drain fully on schedules with >5h of sleep.

The objective of polyphasic sleep is to set up the charging routine and battery level in such a way that your batteries are full and get filled the instant they're drained.

!travelling
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/#travelling>
Being on a polyphasic schedule while also travelling over time zones is possible but hard to pull off. You have a few options:
-Sticking with the original schedule (with respect to your original timezone)
-Rotating the schedule to fit the new timezone
-Returning to monophasic sleep

The best route is to stick with the original schedule during the travel, but depending on the duration of the stay rotating the schedule should also be possible. Note that rotating the schedule will cause adaptation to be set back. During adaptation it’s important to stick to all sleeping times, and rotating would negatively affect it.
Jetlag happens when you travel through different time zones. If you go with changing your schedule during the stay you will initially struggle to fall asleep fast in the new time zone, and your schedule will become a mess. Depending on how long your trip is, how long you stay in the new region, and how long you have been polyphasic the travel can be hard or relatively easy to handle.

Plan the trip so your core aligns with the flight if possible.

Try not to core in the airports, as you will be vulnerable to thefts, personal safety, etc.

If you're adapted you can flex the naps if possible. Skipping will also be more manageable, and small oversleeps tolerable.

If you haven't started your schedule yet waiting until after the trip is probably the best option.

!underage
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/#age>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggAIZjFv_do>

Underaged people (under 18) should generally avoid cutting sleep. Those under 16 should avoid cutting any sleep at all from their mono baseline. Those over 16 are advised to stay above 6 hours of total sleep, since both their brain and body are still developing, and cutting out light sleep could have detrimental effects. These schedules are recommended if you are between 16 and 18:
- E1 (6h20m)
- Siesta (6h30m, even Siesta-extended is plausible, clocking in at 7,5h sleep)
- Segmented (7h).
Check `!biphasic` for more info on these schedules.
Other schedules with more than 6h total sleep time include:
- DC1-ext (6h20m)
- Triphasic-ext (6h0m)
- QC0 (6h0m)


!biphasic
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTuXDyN7YMo>
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/biphasic/>
The Biphasic schedule group includes all schedules with two sleeps per day, which are siesta, E1, and segmented. These schedules have been used by humans throughout history, and might be more natural than monophasic sleep. In general, these are also the easiest schedules to adapt to and thus recommended for beginners and underaged people who need more sleep.

Siesta is good if you have no previous napping experience, since it has a full sleep cycle during the day Siesta has a 5h core in the night, and a 1.5h core in the day. For those with higher sleep requirements siesta-extended is also possible, which has a 6h core instead, bringing the total sleep to 7.5h.

E1 uses a 6h core at night and a 20min nap in the day for an energy boost. Because relatively little sleep is cut compared to mono, you might have to wait several weeks to be able to sleep for the nap. It also allows for more tolerance in scheduling than other Everyman schedules.

Segmented is a bit harder, since it requires the body to split up the core into two parts. However, at 7h total sleep, it should still be relatively easy. Segmented would be preferable if you naturally wake up at night. Otherwise, the quality of the sleep should be the same as the rest.

You can look at each of them in <#257401368807997440> with the commands `+e1`, `+siesta` and `+segmented`, or on the linked polynet page.

!solartime
All the optimal sleep timings given here are in terms of solar time, defined by local midnight at 00:00 and noon at 12:00. Depending on your location, the actual clock time might be quite different from solar time. Such places would include:
- Anywhere where DST is in effect (Up to ~1.5h difference)
- Spain, and to a lesser extent France, especially during DST (Up to ~2.5h difference)
- Eastern Russia (Up to ~2h difference)
- Western China (Up to ~3h difference)
To determine if you live in one of these places, you can look up local solar noon time, or calculate the midpoint between sunrise and sunset times manually.
When planning your schedule, please take into consideration your local timezones. For example, if you live in Madrid, Spain and DST is in effect, taking an E3 core at 00:00 local time would be advisable, since it would only be 22:00 in terms of solar time.

If you live close to the poles, this is less important because circadian management will be necessary anyways. Check `!darkperiod` and `!circadian` for more info.

!circadian-structure
A typical circadian rhythm structure looks like this:

SWS peak: 21:00-00:00
Nocturnal sleep: 00:00-04:00
Min core body temperature: 04:00-06:00
REM peak: 06:00-09:00
Highest alertness: 09:00-11:00
Ideal nap zone: 11:00-17:00
Max core body temperature: 17:00-19:00
Forbidden zone of sleep: 19:00-21:00

Graveyard hours: 00:00-08:00
Midday alertness dip: 12:00-15:00





!non-reducing
<https://polyphasic.net/schedules/non-reducing-polyphasic-schedules/>

Non-reducing polyphasic schedules refer to any sleep schedules that don’t reduce the amount of time spent in bed in comparison with personal monophasic sleep need.

Types of the non-reducing schedules:
1. Extended schedules: Any regular strict schedule with an extended core(-s), so it’s total sleep time is the same as your monophasic baseline or very close to it. For example:
2. Alternating schedules. These are not strict, and usually are done without alarms from the very beginning. Examples include Biphasic-X (usually long core at night with a natural wake + no-alarm nap during the day), natural Segmented sleep (cores’ length usually varies from day to day) or experimental TRICAMAYL (three sleeps of the varying lengths without alarms, wasn’t attempted and approved yet).

!napaware
If you ever feel like you are aware during a nap and are questioning whether you are asleep or not. You were almost definitely sleeping, what you are experiencing is a state of lucidness. It can also be known as WILD where you enter a lucid state from the very beginning of going to sleep.

This appears to be common whilst learning to nap for people. One trick to provide some cognitive feedback to help improve the symptoms of this experience and fall into a deeper sleep is by playing some kind of noise (fan, rain, brown, white, binaural etc) 15 minutes into your 20 minute nap.

When you wake up, try to recall if you remember the exact point the noise turned off. Chances are you won't have any recollection of the noise turning off. You have just provided your brain some feedback! Do this for a few weeks and the experience will improve, you may still get the lucid experience but they will feel much deeper.

The trick is to just get a feel for what it's like to be lucid and sleeping at the same time.


!fzs
<https://polyphasic.net/blog/the-forbidden-zone-of-sleep/>

The forbidden zone of sleep (FZS) is defined as a period of time of natural wakefulness right before the onset of nocturnal sleep. During this period, the body has a high tendency to resist sleep and it is usually impossible to fall asleep. Under normal sleep conditions (based on normal nocturnal monophasic sleep and no sleep deprivation), FZS hours vary from 19:00 to 21:00 or 22:00. It is worth noting that the regular FZS hours are not set in stone and have the potential to vary between individuals depending on lifestyle.

Under sleep deprivation conditions, homeostatic pressure can take over FZS, facilitating sleep at these hours. It is also worth noting that even though 21:00 is borderline with FZS, it is possible and reasonable to start sleeping at this evening hour (if it fits your lifestyle) because natural melatonin release starts at 21:00.

!insomnia
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/medical-cautions/#insomnia>
Polyphasic sleep can help with insomnia. Because total sleep time is reduced, the body has to learn to fall asleep quickly in order to get all the rest it needs. Many of the recommended practices in polyphasic sleeping improve sleep in general, such as dark period (check `!darkperiod`) , consistent timings (check `!discipline`), and drugs (check `!caffeine`, `!alcohol`, and `!cannabis`). These could help you fall asleep much sooner than before, potentially treating your insomnia.



!medical
<https://polyphasic.net/lifestyle-considerations/medical-cautions/>
Many physical and mental illnesses can make polyphasic adaptation difficult, impossible, or unadvisable. The sleep deprivation caused by an adaptation can worsen some of these conditions such as epilepsy or depression. Other conditions such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy can greatly reduce your sleep quality or control of sleep, making it impossible to adapt without getting it treated first. Some medications such as stimulants and antidepressants can reduce sleep quality and/or increase sleep need, which would also preclude most forms of polyphasic sleep. Please note that none of these constitutes medical advice, and you should check with your doctor when in doubt.

!longterm
Can you maintain your polyphasic long term? Look ahead in your work/study schedule, and your future life, several months ahead. Adaptation to a sleep schedule usually takes at least one month, if you're strict and lucky. So, if you only have, for example, a month and a half, you shouldn't attempt polyphasic sleep at all, because you will have little time to enjoy the period of success before having to switch. It's just not worth the effort you put in and reduced productivity you incur.


!wake-time-programming
<https://polyphasic.net/sleep-mechanics/polyphasic-sleep-adaptation/#wake-time-programming>
If you wake up at the same times of day consistently, the brain will learn to insert light sleep at that exact time, leading to an easier and more pleasant wake. In time, it even becomes likely that you’ll wake up entirely of your own accord at this point without needing an alarm. This usually happens when the brain starts inserting some light sleep at the end of sleep blocks.
